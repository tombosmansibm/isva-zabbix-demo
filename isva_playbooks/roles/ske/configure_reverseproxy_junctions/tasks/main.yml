      NAME
        configure_reverseproxy_junctions

      DESCRIPTION
        Role to configure reverse proxy junctions

      STEPS
        1) Configure reverse proxy junctions per instance [-e inst_name=<instance> -e junction_point=</jct_point>]
        1.a) Create junction with 1st junction server
        1.b) Add junction servers
        1.c) Delete junction servers that are missing in the inventory [-e delete_junction_server=True]
        2) Delete junctions that are missing in the inventory [-e delete_junctions=True]
        3) Commit changes

      EXAMPLES
        ansible-playbook -i [...] playbooks/ansible_collections/web/configure_reverseproxy_junctions.yml // create and add all inventory defined junctions
        ansible-playbook -i [...] playbooks/ansible_collections/web/configure_reverseproxy_junctions.yml -e delete_junction_server=True -e delete_junctions=True // create, add all inventory defined junctions and delete all junction servers or junctions that are missing from inventory
        ansible-playbook -i [...] playbooks/ansible_collections/web/configure_reverseproxy_junctions.yml -e inst_name=default // create and add inventory defined junctions for instance default only
        ansible-playbook -i [...] playbooks/ansible_collections/web/configure_reverseproxy_junctions.yml -e junction_point=/jct1 // do all tasks only if junction equals /jct1
        ansible-playbook -i [...] playbooks/ansible_collections/web/configure_reverseproxy_junctions.yml -e junction_point=/jct2 -e delete_junction_server=True -e delete_junctions=True // if junction_point renamed in inventory to /jct2, then this command can reconfigure that junction server under the new name
        ansible-playbook -i [...] playbooks/ansible_collections/web/configure_reverseproxy_junctions.yml -e junction_point=/jct1 -e force=True // re-configure junction /jct1

Use onfocus to use the onfocus event handler in the JavaScript to ensure the correct junction cookie is used in a multiple-junction/multiple-browser-window scenario. Use xhtml10 to insert a JavaScript block that is HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 compliant.

By default, the Windows file is called query_contents.exe and the UNIX file is called query_contents.sh. By default, the Reverse Proxy looks for the file in the cgi_bin directory of the back-end Web server. Required for back-end Windows and UNIX Web servers.
                  https_port: 444                                       # HTTPS port of the back-end third-party server. Applicable when the junction type is ssl.

Causes a second virtual junction to share the protected object space with the initial virtual junction. This option is appropriate for junction pairs only (2 junctions with complementary protocols). The option does not support the association of more than 2 junctions.
                  server_uuid: server2_uuid                             # Specifies the UUID that will be used to identify the junctioned Web server. This field is used for stateful junctions.

                  sms_environment: vhostA.example.com                   # Only applicable for virtual junctions. Specifies the replica set that sessions on the virtual junction are managed under. The replica set also provides the ability to group or separate log in sessions among multiple virtual hosts. If this option is not used to specify the replica set, the virtual host junction is automatically assigned to a replica set matching its virtual host name. For example, if the virtual host name is vhostA.example.com, the replica set is named vhostA.example.com. The replica set used for the virtual host junction must be present in the [replica-sets] stanza of the Reverse Proxy configuration file. This option cannot be used in a non-DSC environment.
                  local_ip: "192.168.42.1"                              # Specifies the local IP address that the Reverse Proxy uses when the system communicates with the target back-end server. If this option is not provided, the Reverse Proxy uses the default address as determined by the operating system. If you supply an address for a particular junction, the Reverse Proxy is modified to bind to this local address for all communication with the junctioned server.
